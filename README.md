ch-ioc
======

IoC for Infrastructure wiring.

See the CH.Ioc.Test projects for an example of how this should be used.

Note: The ref's to the TestPlugin and TestHost assemblies are only used to get the dll (assembly) copied into the build output. I'll replace that with a post build setup soon so it's clear that they are loaded dynamically.
